git-conflicts


changes on different files
=============================

git push rejected: the tip of your current branch is behind the remote branch

to solve:
do: git pull
do: git push


what is happening under the hood when we do git pull?
1: git fetches where our local repo is synced with remote one
	the local repo is not updated
	 in the local repo git created a branch called orgin/master

	master branch 				oringin/master
	(local repo)				(created from remote in local repo)


2: git merges the oringin/master with master (git merge origin/master)

3: create a merge commit
	the two branches master & origin/master merged on merge commit

4: git push to origin/master in remote repo




changes on same file
=====================
two different commit on the same file

merge conflict on <filename>

edit the file manually
do: git commit -a
do:  merger commit in editor
do: git push to orgin/master
