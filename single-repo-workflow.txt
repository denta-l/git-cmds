single-repo-workflow


everyone is working on a clone of the same repo from github
if everyone is puhsing to the master branch, you will end up facing conflict on a regular basis
use a feature branch strategy
where everyone is working on their own separate feature branches on that single repo
each developer can collaboreate on each feature branch
	git fetch
	git branch -a
	git checkout <feature branch>

	when a feature is done, any member can check it out, run test and merge to master branch and push that up to git hub

	create a branch locally:
	----------------------
	git checkout -b kill_list
	git add .
	git commit -m "comment"
	git push -u origin kill_list (pushed the branch to github with the same name & sets the default upstream for the branch)

	create a pull request (to master branch)
	master....kill_list
